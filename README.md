# Image-Morphing
Image morphing using the Beier-Neely algorithm along with auto correspondence.

## Milestones
- UI for input of image paths
- UI for line segment capturing
- Image Transform using single line pair
- Image Transform using multiple line pair
- Generating Intermediate Frames forward transform
- Generating reverse transform
- Cross Fading between intermediate frames of both direction
- Automatic correspondence-maarker generation
